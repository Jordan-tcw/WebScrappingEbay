# WebScrappingEbay
**Web scraping**, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programmatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” is a powerful tool for working with data on the web.<br/>

With a web crawler, you can mine data about a set of products, get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around with, get data from a site without an official API, or just satisfy your own personal curiosity.<br/>

In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the fundamentals of the scraping and spidering process as you explore a playful data set. We’ll use **EBAY**, a community-run site that contains information about Products sets. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional Python web crawler that collects a products information on **Ebay**.<br/>

This is a stepping stone for WebScrawling
